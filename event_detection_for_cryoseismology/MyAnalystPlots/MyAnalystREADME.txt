Discussion of the prototype catalogue and MyAnalystPlots:

In Event detection for cryoseismology (Latto et al., 2022 in prep) we present the application of a novel event detection algorithm to continuous seismic data from the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) 2010—2011 austral summer deployment. The WIS is surrounded by a heterogeneous, noisy wavefield from the nearby Ross Ice Shelf and Ross Sea. The produced event catalogue is accordingly a prototype catalogue that has utility for research of the WIS region. The catalogue includes diverse signals, such as local stick-slip and teleseismic events, and other signals mostly relating to noise from multiple generative sources.

We guide the user through the catalogue by providing the MyAnalystPlots data visualisation software and PDF products in https://github.com/beccalatto/multi_sta_lta. Each PDF product displays an event per page. For each event, the WIS seismograms are plotted in the E, N, and Z components, for each triggered station ordered by event arrival time. The seismograms have been detrended and filtered according to the bandpass filter parameters provided in the textbox by the HP (highpass) and LP (lowpass) descriptions. The semi-transparent, red highlight over each seismogram covers the duration of detection, which can be variable for each station. The station to trigger on for the earliest arrival time is noted in the textbox with ‘t0’ and that corresponding station seismogram per E, N, and Z component is listed first and vertically aligned at the 0-minute mark on the x-axis. 

The event detection software synthesises the individual station start times and durations to assign a reference start time and event duration. These are provided by the plot title event ID and in the textbox, respectively.

The PDF products are organised into groups based on the event labels assigned by an expert analyst, denoted following the ‘RL label:’ in each plot title. The labels were first assigned in a rigorous manual appraisal and then, if possible, cross-referenced for validation with event start times from available labelled seismic catalogues (e.g. global earthquake database). Any mismatch between event presentation and designated ‘RL label’ is due to analyst error or issues in the automated process of labelling based on the comparison of the prototype event start times with known event start times.

Using the MyAnalystPlot visual tool, a user can assess each event’s validity by checking for cases 1, 2, and 3:

(Case 1) Event coincides with intuitive event detection (i.e., the red highlight corresponds to seismic amplitude increases).
(Case 2) Event is real but not evident by initial reading of the PDF plot. Multiple, successive station triggers would add confidence to this assessment*. In this case, the user can typically expect one of two scenarios:
1.	Event occurs off the page (i.e. the reference start time is more than 55 minutes after initial station arrival time).
2.	Event is not visible at the plotted amplitude limits with the applied bandpass filters, potentially due to coincident high-amplitude, low-frequency noisy events or artificial noise (e.g. wind or instrument response). 
(Case 3) Event is not real. 

We quantify the uncertainty in the WIS prototype events by designing a routine that assigns confidence flags. First, we assign each of the 14 stations in our study a set of 5 nearest stations by calculating relative distances. Then, each event from the catalogue is fed into our algorithm, which iterates through the list of stations that triggered for each event and removes stations that are outliers (i.e. stations not in any given set of nearest stations). We then compare the length of the remaining station list with the coincidence sum (3, in this case). If the list of stations length is greater than or equal to the coincidence sum of 3, the event is ‘High’ confidence. In other glacier environments and event catalogues, the parameters for the number of nearest stations per set and coincidence sum could vary.

The confidence flags assigned are useful given the diverse nature of the WIS environment because it is a near-impossible task to manually review each potential Case 3 event to determine what has led to detection by the algorithm. Probable interpretations of event confidence flags are as follows: High confidence events are likely local (e.g. stick-slip) or potentially external, high-energy events (e.g. global earthquake), assigned with the assumption that such events are detected by contiguous stations. Low confidence events potentially pertain to the external wavefield, as sources outside the WIS would have a weaker effect on the in-situ WIS seismometers, so could be detected by non-contiguous stations. Within the low confidence events, we can also expect some events to have no real source but cannot provide an estimate for how many given the lack of information available, particularly in the context of Antarctic studies.

We find that 35% of the total 1856 events are flagged high confidence. We choose to use both the high confidence events and the low confidence events to enable for a rich, diverse dataset that we aim to further understand with unsupervised learning.
