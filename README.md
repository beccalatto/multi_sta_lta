Here, users can find the data and code used for generating the event catalogues in Event detection for cryoseismology.

# catalogue/
The reference and trace catalogues for the MSL, RECmin, and RECmax applications. See text for full descriptions of the MSL, RECmin, and RECmax abbreviations.

# multi_sta_lta/
Use the multi_sta_lta Use Guide (.pdf) to learn how to download the entry_points.txt and trigger.py files and to incorporate them into an already established ObsPy library.

# utilities/
Herein, find the code created for producing plots (in utilities/MyAnalystPlots_examples/) of some of the events in the MSL catalogues (available within catalogue/). The MyAnalystPlots.py script enables for event viewing in all three components (E,N,Z) and all stations that detect an event. 

## /MyAnalystPlots_examples/
.PDF outputs of MyAnalystPlots.py for MSL events that have known (i.e. verifiable) sources: stick-slip events and teleseisms. .PDF outputs for the 'Other' (i.e. unverifiable) event types that have a high confidence label.
