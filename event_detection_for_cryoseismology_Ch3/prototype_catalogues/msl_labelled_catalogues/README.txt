Below are descriptions for how the Stick-slip and Teleseism labels were verified by analyst.

Stick-slip review


There are 146 events in the prototype catalogue labelled by analyst (RL) as stick-slip. 

Of the 146 events, 136 fall within an assumed 30-minute duration of previously identified start times (Pratt, 2014), labelled ‘STICK-SLIP, PRATT14 ’. The remaining 10 events have been hypothesized as stick-slips by an analyst during manual appraisal. These are labelled ‘STICK-SLIP, PRATT14, additional.

Our assessment of whether an event looks to be stick-slip is based on the expected rupture propagation shape shown previously on the Whillans Ice Stream (Pratt, 2014). From the literature, we can expect “three separate pulses of abrupt ice velocity change during a slip event, each corresponding to the passage of a rupture front” (Pratt, 2014). These temporally-correlated ruptures are referred to as Rupture 1, Rupture 2, and Rupture 3 in descriptions below.

Of the 136 STICK-SLIP, PRATT14, 3 events that fit the requirement of occurring within Pratt, 2014 events do not correspond to visualisable ruptures. Event 20101227T172108Z potentially occurs during a third stick-slip, but it is not verifiable because of the occurrence of a coincident low-frequency event. Events 20110119T154436Z and 20101222T154843Z trigger on and off before the initial stick-slip rupture, so are likely stick-slip related but not an actual stick-slip rupture-type event. However, due to temporal correlation, we keep these 3 events in the STICK-SLIP, PRATT14  label.

For the remaining rupture-type 133 STICK-SLIP, PRATT14  events, 50 events occur during Rupture 1, 42 events during Rupture 2, 26 events clearly encompass at least Ruptures 1 and 2, and 15 events are recorded more than once in the catalogue.

Of the 10 ‘STICK-SLIP, PRATT14, additional’ events, 6 events have uncertainty in the assigned stick-slip label upon further examination. Event IDs 20101221T040052Z, 20101221T180558Z, 20110109T145339Z, 20110122T012709Z, 20110125T004320Z, 20110126T205028Z have coinciding teleseisms and/or other low-frequency signals that confused the seismogram and spectrogram review during the manual appraisal. 

For the remaining rupture-type 4 ‘STICK-SLIP, PRATT14, additional’ events, 2 events are during Rupture 1, 1 event is during Rupture 2, and 1 event clearly encompass at least Ruptures 1 and 2. The stick-slip start times that we would contribute as additional to the Pratt, 2014 catalogue are:

Start time (i.e. ref_time in UTC)	Related event ID (Rupture #)
2010-12-15T02:02:38.887027Z	20101215T020238Z (Rupture 2)
2010-12-19T06:23:36.107027Z	20101219T062336Z (Rupture 1)
2011-01-18T21:12:15.817027Z	20110118T211215Z (Rupture 1)
2011-01-19T00:50:15.682027Z	20110119T005015Z (Rupture 1)


 
Figure1: Comparison  of Whillans Ice Stream stick-slip events previously known (Pratt, 2014) and newly-detected using the multi-STA/LTA, by time of day of rupture and day of the 2010—2011 austral summer deployment. All known Pratt, 2014 events (yellow rectangles; 30-minute set lengths) are detected using the multi-STA/LTA detection algorithm, overlaid as rectangles shown from starttime to duration of event (green rectangles). Additional stick-slips are overlaid (red: verified, grey with red outline; unverified). The temporal context reveals patterns in stick-slip behavior and provides further validation of stick-slip label assignments.
